        <h1 class="beta">Defining functions</h1>

        <br>

        <p>
            In this chapter we introduce a range of mechanisms for defining functions in Haskell. We start with conditional expressions and guarded equations, then introduce the simple but powerful idea of pattern matching, and conclude with the concepts of lambda expressions and sections.
        </p>

        <section>
            <h2 class="gamma"><span>§</span> 4.1. New from old</h2>
            <p>
                Perhaps the most straightforward way to define new functions is simply by combining one or more existing functions. For example, a number of library frunctions that are defined in this way are shown below.

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Decide if a character is a digit:

                        <pre>
                isDigit :: Char → Bool
                isDigit c = c ≥ '0' ∧ c ≤ '9'
                        </pre>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Decide if an integer is even:

                        <pre>
                even :: Integral a ⇒ a → Bool
                even n = n 'mod' 2 == 0
                        </pre>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Split a list at the <i>n</i>th element:
                        <pre>
                splitAt :: Int → [a] → ([a], [a])
                splitAt n xs = (take n xs, drop n xs)
                        </pre>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Reciprocation:
                        <pre>
                recip :: Fractional a ⇒ a → a
                recip n = 1 / n
                        </pre>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p>
                Note the use of the class constraints in the types for <i>even</i> and <i>recip</i> above, which make precise the idea that these functions can be applied to numbers of any integral and fractional types, respectively.
            </p>

        <section>
            <h2 class="gamma"><span>§</span> 4.2. Conditional expressions</h2>

            <p>
                Haskell provides a range of different ways to define functions that choose between a number of possible results. The simplest are <i>conditional expressions</i>, which use a logical expression called a <i>condition</i> to choose between two results of the same type. If the condition is <i>True</i>, then the first result is chosen, and if it is <i>False</i>, then the second result is chosen. For example, the library function <i>abs</i> that returns the absolute value of an integer can be defined as follows:

                <pre>
                    abs :: Int → Int
                    abs n = if n ≥ 0 then n else − n
                </pre>
            </p>

            <p>
                Conditional expressions may be nested, in the sense that they can contain other conditional expressions. For example, the library function <i>signum</i> that returns the sign of an integer can be defined as follows:

                <pre>
                    signum :: Int → Int
                    signum n = if n < 0 then − 1 else
                                 if n == 0 then 0 else 1
                </pre>
            </p>

            <p>
                Note that unlike in some programming languages, conditional expressions in Haskell must always have an <b>else</b> branch, which avoids the well-known “dangling else” problem. For example, if <b>else</b> branches were optional, then the expression <b>if</b> <i>True</i> <b>then</b> <b>if</b> <i>False</i> <b>then</b> 1 <b>else</b> 2 could either return the result 2 or produce an error, depending upon whether the single <b>else</b> branch was assumed to be part of the inner or outer conditional expression.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2 class="gamma"><span>§</span> 4.3. Guarded equations</h2>

            <p>
                As an alternative to using conditional expressions, functions can also be defined using <i>guarded equations</i>, in which a sequence of logical expressions called guards is used to choose between a sequence of results of the same type. If the first guard is <i>True</i>, then the first result is chosen; otherwise, if the second is <i>True</i>, then the second result is chosen, and so on. For example, the library function <i>abs</i> can also be defined as follows:

                <pre>
                    abs n | n ≥ 0     = n
                          | otherwise = −n
                </pre>
            </p>

            <p>
                The symbol | is read as “such that”, and the guard <i>otherwise</i> is defined in the standard prelude simply by <i>otherwise = True</i>. Ending a sequence of guards with <i>otherwise</i> is not necessary, but provides a convenient way of handling “all other cases”, as well as clearly avoiding the possibility that none of the guards in the sequence is <i>True</i>, which would result in an error.
            </p>

            <p>
                The main benefit of guarded equations over conditional expressions is that definitions with multiple guards are easier to read. For example, the library function <i>signum</i> is easier to understand when defined as follows:

                <pre>
                    signumn | n < 0 = −1
                            | n == 0 = 0
                            | otherwise = 1
                </pre>
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2 class="gamma"><span>§</span> 4.4. Pattern matching</h2>

            <p>
                Many functions have a particularly simple and intuitive definition using <i>pattern matching</i>, in which a sequence of syntactic expressions called <i>patterns</i> is used to choose between a sequence of results of the same type. If the first pattern is <i>matched</i>, then the first result is chosen; otherwise, if the second is matched, then the second result is chosen, and so on. For example, the library function ¬ that returns the negation of a logical value is defined as follows:

                <pre>
                    ¬       :: Bool → Bool
                    ¬ False =  True
                    ¬ True  =  False
                </pre>
            </p>

            <p>
                Functions with more than one argument can also be defined using pattern matching, in which case the patterns for each argument are matched in order within each equation. For example, the library operator ∧ that returns the conjunction of two logical values can be defined as follows:

                <pre>
                    (∧)           :: Bool → Bool → Bool
                    True  ∧ True  =  True
                    True  ∧ False =  False
                    False ∧ True  =  False
                    False ∧ False =  False
                </pre>
            </p>

            <p>
                However, this definition can be simplified by combining the last three equations into a single equation that returns <i>False</i> independent of the values of the two arguments, using the <i>wildcard</i> pattern _ that matches any value:

                <pre>
                    True  ^ True  = b
                    False ^ _     = False
                </pre>
            </p>

            <p>
                This version also has the benefit that, under lazy evaluation as discussed in chapter 12, if the first argument is <i>False</i>, then the result <i>False</i> is returned without the need to evaluate the second argument. In practice, the prelude defines ∧ using equations that have this same property, but make the choice about which equation applies using the value of the first argument only:

                <pre>
                    True  ∧ b = b
                    False ∧ _ = False
                </pre>
            </p>

            <p>
                That is, if the first argument is <i>True</i>, then the result is the value of the second argument, and, if the first argument is <i>False</i>, then the result is <i>False</i>.
            </p>

            <p>
                Note that for technical reasons the same name may not be used for more than one argument in a single equation. For example, the following definition for the operator ∧ is based upon the observation that, if the two arguments are equal, then the result is the same value, otherwise the result is <i>False</i>, but is invalid because of the above naming requirement:

                <pre>
                    b ^ b = b
                    _ ^ _ = False
                </pre>
            </p>

            <p>
                If desired, however, a valid version of this definition can be obtained by using a guard to decide if the two arguments are equal:

                <pre>
                    b ∧ c | b == c    = b
                          | otherwise = False
                </pre>
            </p>

            <p>
                So far, we have only considered basic patterns that are either values, variables, or the wildcard pattern. In the remainder of this section we introduce three useful ways to build larger patterns by combining smaller patterns.
            </p>

            <h3 class="epsilon">Tuple patterns</h3>

            <p>
                A tuple of patterns is itself a pattern, which matches any tuple of the same arity whose components all match the corresponding patterns in order. For example, the library functions <i>fst</i> and <i>snd</i> that select the first and second components of a pair are defined as follows:

                <pre>
                    fst       :: (a, b) → a
                    fst (x,_) =  x

                    snd        :: (a, b) → b
                    snd (_, y) =  y
                </pre>
            </p>

            <h3 class="epsilon">List patterns</h3>

            <p>
                Similarly, a list of patterns is itself a pattern, which matches any list of the same length whose elements all match the corresponding patterns in order. For example, a function <i>test</i> that decides if a list contains precisely three characters beginning with <code>'a'</code> can be defined as follows:

                <pre>
                    test             :: [Char] → Bool
                    test ['a', _, _] =  True
                    test _           =  False
                </pre>
            </p>

            <p>
                Up to this point we have viewed lists as a primitive notion in Haskell. In fact they are not primitive as such, but are actually constructed one element at a time starting from the empty list [ ] using an operator : called <i>cons</i> that <i>cons</i>tructs a new list by prepending a new element to the start of an existing list. For example, the list [ 1, 2, 3 ] can be decomposed as follows:

                <pre>
                    [1, 2, 3]
                =       { list notation }
                    1 : [2, 3]
                =       { list notation }
                    1 : (2 : [3])
                =       { list notation }
                    1 : (2 : (3 : []))

                </pre>
            </p>

            <p>
                That is, [1, 2, 3] is just an abbreviation for 1 : (2 : (3 : [ ])). To avoid excess parentheses when working with such lists, the cons operator is assumed to associate to the right. For example, 1 : 2 : 3 : [ ] means 1 : (2 : (3 : [ ])).
            </p>

            <p>
                As well as being used to construct lists, the cons operator can also be used to construct patterns, which match any non-empty list whose first and remaining elements match the corresponding patterns in order. For example, we can now define a more general version of the function <i>test</i> that decides if a list containing any number of characters begins with 'a':

                <pre>
                    test         :: [Char] → Bool
                    test ('a':_) =  True
                    test -       =  False
                </pre>
            </p>

            <p>
                Similarly, the library functions <i>null</i>, <i>head</i> and <i>tail</i> that decide if a list is empty, select the first element of a non-empty list, and remove the first element of a non-empty list are defined as follows:

                <pre>
                    null       :: [a] → Bool
                    null []    =  True
                    null (_:_) =  False

                    head       :: [a] → a
                    head (x:_) =  x

                    tail        :: [a] → [a]
                    tail (_:xs) =  xs
                </pre>
            </p>

            <p>
                Note that cons patterns must be parenthesised, because function applica- tion has higher priority than all other operators. For example, the definition <i>tail _ : xs = xs</i> without parentheses means <i>(tail _) : xs = xs</i>, which is both the incorrect meaning and an invalid definition.
            </p>

            <h3 class="epsilon">Integer patterns</h3>

            <p>
                As a special case that is sometimes useful, Haskell also allows integer patterns of the form <i>n + k</i>, where n is an integer variable and <i>k > 0</i> is an integer constant. For example, a function <i>pred</i> that maps zero to itself and any strictly positive integer to its predecessor can be defined as follows:

                <pre>
                    pred         :: Int → Int
                    pred 0       =  0
                    pred (n + 1) =  n
                </pre>
            </p>

            <p>
                There are two points to note about <i>n + k</i> patterns. First of all, they only match integers <i>≥ k</i>. For example, evaluating <i>pred</i> (−1) produces an error, because neither of the two patterns in the definition for <i>pred</i> matches negative integers. Secondly, for the same reason as cons patterns, integer patterns must be parenthesised. For example, the definition <i>pred n + 1 = n</i> without parentheses means <i>(pred n) + 1 = n</i>, which is an invalid definition.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2 class="gamma"><span>§</span> 4.5. Lambda expressions</h2>

            <p>
                As an alternative to defining functions using equations, functions can also be constructed using <i>lambda expressions</i>, which comprise a pattern for each of the arguments, a body that specifies how the result can be calculated in terms of the arguments, but do not give a name for the function itself. In other words, lambda expressions are nameless functions.
            </p>

            <p>
                For example, a nameless function that takes a single number <i>x</i> as its argument, and produces the result <i>x + x</i>, can be constructed as follows:

                <pre>
                    λ x → x + x
                </pre>
            </p>

            <p>
                The symbol λ is the lower-case Greek letter “lambda”. Despite the fact that they have no names, functions constructed using lambda expressions can be used in the same way as any other functions. For example:

                <pre>
                    > (λ x → x + x) 2
                    4
                </pre>
            </p>

            <p>
                As well as being interesting in their own right, lambda expressions have a number of practical applications. First of all, they can be used to formalise the meaning of curried function definitions. For example, the definition

                <pre>
                    add x y = x + y
                </pre>

                can be understood as meaning

                <pre>
                    add = λ x → (λ y → x + y)
                </pre>

                which makes precise that <i>add</i> is a function that takes a number <i>x</i> and returns a function, which in turn takes a number <i>y</i> and returns the result <i>x + y</i>.

                Secondly, lambda expressions are also useful when defining functions that return functions as results by their very nature, rather than as a consequence of currying. For example, the library function <i>const</i> that returns a constant function that always produces a given value can be defined as follows:

                <pre>
                    const   :: a → b → a
                    const x =  x
                </pre>
            </p>

            <p>
                However, it is more appealing to define <i>const</i> in a way that makes explicit that it returns a function as its result, by including parentheses in the type and using a lambda expression in the definition itself:

                <pre>
                    const   :: a → (b → a)
                    const x =  λ _ → x
                </pre>
            </p>

            <p>
                Finally, lambda expressions can be used to avoid having to name a function that is only referenced once. For example, a function <i>odds</i> that returns the first n odd integers can be defined as follows:

                <pre>
                    odds   :: Int → [Int]
                    odds n =  map f [0..n − 1]
                              where f x = x ∗ 2 + 1
                </pre>
            </p>

            <p>
                (The library function <i>map</i> applies a function to all elements of a list.) However, because the locally defined function <i>f</i> is only referenced once, the definition for <i>odds</i> can be simplified by using a lambda expression:

                <pre>
                    odds n = map (λ x → x ∗ 2 + 1)[0..n − 1]
                </pre>
            </p>

            <p>
                Functions such as + that are written between their two arguments are called <i>operators</i>. As we have already seen, any function with two arguments can be converted into an operator by enclosing the name of the function in single back quotes, as in 7 <i>`div`</i> 2. However, the converse is also possible. In particular, any operator can be converted into a curried function that is written before its arguments by enclosing the name of the operator in parentheses, as in (+) 1 2. Moreover, this convention also allows one of the arguments to be included in the parentheses if desired, as in (1+) 2 and (+2) 1.
            </p>
            <p>
                In general, if ⊕ is an operator, then expressions of the form (⊕), (<i>x</i> ⊕), and (⊕ <i>y</i>) for arguments <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> are called sections, whose meaning as functions can be formalised using lambda expressions as follows:

                <pre>
                    (⊕)   = λx → (λy → x ⊕ y)
                    (x ⊕) = λy → x ⊕ y
                    (⊕y)  = λx → x ⊕ y
                </pre>
            </p>

            <p>
                Sections have three main applications. First of all, they can be used to construct a number of simple but useful functions in a particularly compact way, as shown in the following examples:
                <ul>
                    <li><code>(+)</code> is the addition function <code>λx → (λy → x + y)</code></li>
                    <li><code>(1+)</code> is the successor function <code>λy → 1 + y</code></li>
                    <li><code>(1/)</code> is the reciprocation function <code>λy → 1 / y</code></li>
                    <li><code>(∗2)</code> is the doubling function <code>λx → x ∗ 2</code></li>
                    <li><code>(/2)</code> is the halving function <code>λx → x / 2</code></li>
                </ul>
                <br>
            </p>

            <p>
                Secondly, sections are necessary when stating the type of operators, because an operator itself is not a valid expression in Haskell. For example, the type of the logical conjunction operator ∧ is stated as follows:

                <pre>
                    (∧) :: Bool → Bool → Bool
                </pre>
            </p>

            <p>
                Finally, sections are also necessary when using operators as arguments to other functions. For example, the library function <i>and</i> that decides if all logical values in a list are <i>True</i> is defined by using the operator ∧ as an argument to the library function <i>foldr</i>, which is itself discussed in chapter 7:

                <pre>
                    and :: [Bool] → Bool
                    and =  foldr (∧) True
                </pre>
            </p>

                A formal meaning for pattern matching by translation using more primitive features of the language is given in the Haskell Report <a href="#fn-item1" id="fn-return1">[1]</a>. The Greek letter λ used when defining nameless functions comes from the <i>lambda calculus</i>, the mathematical theory of functions upon which Haskell is founded.
